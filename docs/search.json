This confirms the engineered feature is highly predictive of the rating skew towards one color.\nTurns: Game length has only a weak correlation with ratings (0.12 to 0.15)."

Game Outcome Analysis\n\n2.1 Winner and Victory Stats Distribution\n\n\nWinner: White wins the largest share of games, consistent with the first-move advantage in chess.\nVictory Status: Resignation is the most common end-game status, followed by Checkmate, suggesting players know they are rarely able to revert a losing position.\n\n\n\n2.2 Rating Influence on Outcome\nThe histogram below shows the distribution of the rating difference, separated by the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distributions are distinctly separated. The mass of the “white” wins is centered where White had a positive rating advantage, and the mass of the “black” wins is centered where Black had a positive rating advantage (negative rating difference). This visually confirms that the higher-rated player is more likely to win, regardless of color.\n\n\n2.3 Game Lenght by Victory Status\nThe box plot illustrates the typical number of turns required for each victory status.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations:\n\nLongest Games: Games ending in a Draw tend to be the longest (highest median and upper quartile), as balanced positions require extensive play.\nResignation/Mate: These outcomes occur at a similar median game length, suggesting that decisive mistakes or tactical breakthroughs happen mid-game."

    "text": "4. Conclusions\nThe primary factor influencing the game outcome is the rating difference between the players, confirming that the higher-rated participant is statistically favored to win, regardless of playing color. White maintains a slight overall winning edge, supporting the notion of the first-move advantage.\nGame endings are predominantly characterized by resignation or checkmate rather than time or draw-related outcomes, indicating a decisive result is achieved in the majority of contests. Furthermore, the analysis of popular openings revealed substantial imbalances, with specific lines, such as the Scandinavian Defense: Mieses-Kotroc Variation and the Van’t Kruijs Opening, showing stark bias toward one color."
